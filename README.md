## 💡 Featured Projects

### [Medibox](https://github.com/Viren815/Medibox)

MediBox is designed to simplify how patients and healthcare providers manage and access medical records. Each patient may respond differently to the same medication, making it vital for doctors to have quick, accurate prescription histories. By offering a centralized digital repository for prescriptions, MediBox eliminates tedious record-keeping and enables personalized, efficient healthcare.

- **Key Benefits**:  
  - Centralized prescription repository for convenient medical record management  
  - Streamlined access for healthcare professionals, enabling more personalized treatment  
  - Reduces manual data handling, minimizing errors and saving time

- **Research Publication**:  
  - The solution’s impact on medical data management was significant enough to warrant a **research paper**, now published on IEEE.  
  - [**View the Published Paper**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10101968)

> **Tech Highlights**: The project uses modern frameworks and adheres to best practices in data handling, ensuring security and scalability for healthcare applications.

### [Eye For Vision](https://github.com/Viren815/Eye-For-Vision)
We implemented an object detection system using the COCO dataset and YOLO v3 to assist visually impaired users. The model identifies whether objects are located to the left, right, or center, and it also estimates their distance. Additionally, we integrated the Google Translate API to convert detected information into voice feedback, guiding blind users in real-time.
